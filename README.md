### What's going on here?

This repository is all about running some unit tests for Lab 6. But honestly, the dog in the picture looks more confident about it than I am. If you think you're up to the task, feel free to judge me — but do it **unit test style**, please.

### Features
- Tests written by someone who may or may not have had their morning coffee.
- Automated CI setup that keeps breaking (like my patience).
- Vulnerable packages? Sure, but they add flavor.

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository (don't worry, the dog won't bite).
2. Run `dotnet build` — or stare at the screen like the dog if it fails.
3. Execute `dotnet test` to see if the tests pass... or if you'll get that skeptical side-eye from our four-legged friend.

### License
You’re free to do whatever you want, but I’d appreciate it if you left the dog alone. He’s been through enough.

If you encounter issues, just remember the face above — that's my reaction, too.
